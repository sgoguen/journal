# Modeling Half-Baked Ideas

I'm not a fan of crypto-currency in its current form.  Just to get it out of the way, I'm going to give a list of
reason why most people don't like it.  I agree with some. I'm not sure about others, but I have my own reasons for
disliking the current state of crypto-currency that I don't think gets enough discussion.

Here's a list:

* It's not a currency. It's a speculative investment.
* It's a ponzi and pyramid scheme and a scam and bubble all at once.
* It's a waste of energy and will accelerate global warming.
* It facilitates money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal activities.
* It's a distraction from real problems and real solutions.
* It's a solution in search of a problem and the problems it is trying to solve are better solved with more conventional
and time-tested solutions.
* People have a very superficial understanding of the technology and the economics and they end up creating buggy
solutions that don't work, don't scale, and exploitable by hackers or other bad actors.
* After 10 years, it's still not solving real problems.

# My Criticism of Crypto-Currency

My criticism of crypto-currency isn't so much a criticism of the technology, but the accelerating ignorance of how
the world used to work when all we had was paper.  As Boomers and Gen-Xers die off, our society is quickly losing skills
that kept the world running up until this point. They did it with paper and ink. Before the internet, the network moved paper
and ink around the world.  Transactions were done by putting your ink and signature on a pre-printed check and handing it over
to a person who had no idea if they could actually redeem your paper.  They had to trust you.  They had to trust the bank.
They had to trust that there was enough incentive for you to not steal the money.  If they were wrong, they'd have to
write off the loss and move on.

They made it work.  

They used the crudest building blocks of information technology and built a system of people that made the system work, for the most part.

I think it's important that we take the time to appreciate the ingenuity of these paper-based systems, because I think we can
learn a tremendous amount from them and we can apply those lessons to make better IT systems that work for everybody, not just
the Fortune 500 companies that can afford to hire the best and brightest.

I think we can apply these lessons to build:

* True distributed systems
* that solve real problems
* with simpler tools
* that are more secure
* and benefit all of us

# The Ingenuity of Paper Money

Paper money wasn't the product of some brilliant mind working for a king. It actually existed for 200 years in China before
rulers began to standardize and regulate it. It actually started off as a tool that merchants used to facilitate trade so they
didn't have to carry around heavy bags of gold and silver.

I know what you're thinking:  Accepting, what is essentially an IOU, is an incredibly risky proposition.  What if the person
doesn't hand over the gold or silver?  How did they make it work?  How did traders mitigate the risk?

# The Paper Money System

If you were to try to bootstrap your own paper money system today, you'd probably fail because people don't have a paper money
problem to solve. They have a lack of money problem. But it's not the money they're after, it's the goods and services that
the money can buy.

Even with gold and silver, the point of acquiring gold and silver is to use it to buy goods and services, either in the near
future or at some point in the future.  Because money is such a ubiquitous focal point of our lives, it's easy to forget that
it is ONE tool serving a larger purpose, and not the purpose itself.

Here's another way of looking at gold and silver:  They are implicit IOUs.  Nobody has actually sworn on a stack of bibles that
they will exchange gold and silver for goods and services and there is no central authority forces people to accept gold and silver.
They have value because they have an excellent track record of being exchanged for things of value. Like anything, their value fluctuates
up and down based on demand.

Like an IOU, gold and silver act like tokens of credit.

When someone gives me an IOU saying, "This can be redeemed for 1 loaf of bread", I have been given a token of credit that I can redeem
sometime later.  My token of credit represents their debt to me.  If we were to log my bread credit into an accounting system, my credit
and their debt would balance out, because debits and credits must always line up.

# Store Credit

Before credit cards became popular, some stores would offer store credit to regular customers they trusted to pay back their debt.

Like anything, this was risky because you never knew if/when a customer might fall on hard times.  But it wasn't always an all or nothing
situation.  Sometimes it was in the store's best interest to give the customer extra time to pay back their debt.  If the store helped the
customer weather the storm, the customer would more likely become a loyal customer. The customer has first-hand experience that if this 
were to happen again, there's a good chance store would be willing to help them out again.

What I want to highlight about these systems is not that they're built on idealism and blind trust, but on practicality.

When a store offers store credit (In exchange for your debt), they're doing it to keep your business. Sometimes they're doing it because
they know they can charge you more. They are offering it for your loyalty for their benefit because they want your future business.

And there's the rub.  When stores used to offer store credit, they did it with people they knew and with people with whom they expected to 
do repeat business.  Grocery stores would offer store credit and write down the amount of the debt in a ledger and provide a receipt of their
debt.  When the customer came back to pay off part of their debt, the store would deduct that amount from their ledger and give the customer
a receipt for the payment.

At the end of the day, if you were to add up all the entries in the ledger and compare it to the sum of all the receipts, they would balance
out.

We used this paper-based ledger system for hundreds of years and it worked.  It didn't work perfectly, but it worked well enough that it
allowed us to build a society that was more prosperous than any other society in history.

It was inherently distributed and the network to distribute these transactions was slow and expensive.  It would take days for a transaction
to be processed.  But people made it work using technology that was thousands of years old, paper and ink.

# The Virtue of Tolerating Some Inefficiency and Fraud

The thing I dislike the most about the crypto-currency is the Pollyanna culture that pervades it. I especially how disingenous hucksters are intent on cultivating a loyal 
cult following by flooding social media with vaccous memes and platitudes like, "#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy."

Oy fucking vey.

Clearly this message is intended to appeal to the most gullible and naive among us, which is at best, predatory.

I hate that we've become a society where we let predators prey on people so openly and without fear. Maybe it's my hillbilly roots, but I'm not a fan of people who prey on hopeful people. I really hate them. It's not so much that I want to see them suffer, it's that I want society to see that people who prey on the vulnerable will find that their life's purpose was as a warning to others not to fuck with innocent people.

The cruel irony is:  Hucksters like this know how to convince vulnerable people that they want to solve their problems.  They prop up a vague, or specific enemy, and then promise to fight on their behalf.  Who doesn't want to believe someone is fighting on your behalf and offering you hope?

# We Need to Offer Grounded Hope

People need hope.  They need to believe that things can get better.

We won't be able to fight these hope peddling predators if we don't provide them with the tools to build their own hope.

# My Early Bitcoin Optimism

I totally get it, and I'm not faulting anyone for being optimistic.  I was optimistic too.  I was optimistic when I read about Bitcoin in 2009.
I remember the precursor tech to Bitcoin, like Digicash, Hashcash and B-money. Like other nerds, I spent time reading about micro-payments and talking 
with fellow nerds about how one could create a secure electronic micro-payment system.  So when I read about Bitcoin, a lot of us understood
the premise immediately and saw how the using merkle trees and proof-of-work hashing could create a distributed ledger that was difficult (not impossible)
to hack and forge.








When you look at it from that perspective, you can see how the traders in China were able to rationalize 



It's a combination of trust, reputation, and a system of checks
and balances.  It's a system that's been around for thousands of years and it's still in use today.

How does this system of checks and balances work?  How do you incentivize people to do the right thing, and discourage them from
doing the wrong thing?  How do you make sure that the system works for everybody?

# The System of Checks and Balances

The system of checks and balances is a system of incentives.  It's a system of rewards and punishments.  It's a system of
reputation and trust.  In order to make a system like this work, you need some fundamental building blocks:

* You have to know the people involved in the system and their reputation must follow them in a way that benefits them when
they do the right thing and punishes them when they do the wrong thing.
