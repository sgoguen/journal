# I Need Your Help

I need your help. I usually don't know how to ask for people's help, but I really want 
your help. I spent a lot of my career relying on myself and not asking people for 
help, but I know that I can't possibly do the things I think should be done alone.

I am all too aware of my limitations.

I'm reaching out to you because I think what I'm trying to do is hard. More importantly,
I think you have a good heart and you care about things bigger than yourself. The world
needs people like you, to get regularly get together with other people for some benevolant
purpose.

I'm also reaching out because I think have adopted some kind of meaning. 

## My Proposal

We hit it off right away and when I started working with him I would stop by his office almost 
every day.  If I didn't, he would often call me over and he'd have a question for me, some idea for 
something and always wanted to know what I thought about it.

He was a fun boss and we would build stuff together. He knew I was really into programming and teaching, 
so he let me teach him things because he was a civil engineer by training.  While I would show him how to 
refactor things, solve things with a functional-first approach, he would pull me into to the business 
strategy and always invested the time to remind me why we're doing what we're doing. 

We spent a lot of time working together and usually had lunch together most days of the week.  In our
conversations, we might zoom out and talk about big things like politics and philisophical questions 
or we'd zoom in and get lost into the details and nuances of how everyday things are designed. 


 He involved took me on trips to meet with partnering 
companies and he always treated me with respect, especially when we argued. The more heated the argument,
the calmer he would get. He could have simply put his foot down, but it was more important that he got me
on board in some capacity. Sometimes it was reluctant, but I never felt railroaded.


and small things. We'd often sit down and he always had a thought provoking question that would really make me think about
a problem. Sometimes, he'd ask something like: "How do you convince someone its in their best 
interest to think critically?" Other days, he might ask me if I thought you could solve a problem with
blockchains, merkle trees or something else...

He always cared about what I thought and he checked in regularly.

If we were having this conversation right now, he'd probably ask a series of questions and follow-up questions:

"How do you scale that up? How do you create a venue for people to check in on each other regularly and engage them?
Would you use a blockchain? ;)"
