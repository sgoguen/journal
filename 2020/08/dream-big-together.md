# How do we Dream Big - Together?

As I sat down to write this, I started prefacing this post by trying to convince you that I am 
not a dreamer and I'm a seasoned pro who's seen hype cycles come and go. I wanted to convince you
that I'm credible and worthy of your attention. I ended up writing a bunch of nonsense and deleting 
it because I knew I wasn't getting to the point.

In the cutting words of Frankie Bergstein, "Fuck that noise!"

I'll cut through the bullshit.  Here's my thesis:

## I Need Your Help

I'm not good at saying those words. To be honest, the first 10 years of my career weren't very 
collaborative. Most of my bosses gave me an incredible amount of leeway to call the shots, so I 
often had the pleasure of living with my mistakes or fixing them.

Then I finally got a boss who really engaged me.

We hit it off right away and when I started working with him I would stop by his office almost 
every day.  If I didn't, he would often call me over and he'd have a question for me, some idea for 
something and always wanted to know what I thought about it.

He was a fun boss and we would build stuff together. He knew I was really into programming and teaching, 
so he let me teach him things because he was a civil engineer by training.  While I would show him how to 
refactor things, solve things with a functional-first approach, he would pull me into to the business 
strategy and always invested the time to remind me why we're doing what we're doing. 

We spent a lot of time working together and usually had lunch together most days of the week.  In our
conversations, we might zoom out and talk about big things like politics and philisophical questions 
or we'd zoom in and get lost into the details and nuances of how everyday things are designed. 


 He involved took me on trips to meet with partnering 
companies and he always treated me with respect, especially when we argued. The more heated the argument,
the calmer he would get. He could have simply put his foot down, but it was more important that he got me
on board in some capacity. Sometimes it was reluctant, but I never felt railroaded.


and small things. We'd often sit down and he always had a thought provoking question that would really make me think about
a problem. Sometimes, he'd ask something like: "How do you convince someone its in their best 
interest to think critically?" Other days, he might ask me if I thought you could solve a problem with
blockchains, merkle trees or something else...

He always cared about what I thought and he checked in regularly.

If we were having this conversation right now, he'd probably ask a series of questions and follow-up questions:

"How do you scale that up? How do you create a venue for people to check in on each other regularly and engage them?
Would you use a blockchain? ;)"
