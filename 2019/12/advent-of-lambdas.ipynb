    "I first learned about Lambda calculus a 15 years and I'm still amazed by it for so many reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Lambda calculus was introduced in the 1930's by Alonzo Church back when mathematicians were looking for an axiomatic foundation and algorithm where they could feed in an arbitrary statement written in some type of formal language to see if the statement was true or false.  While mathematicians were able to construct formal languages to encode these questions, they learned there are simply some questions that simply won't ever return a simple true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I'm still absolutely enamoured by Church's lambda calculus because he was able to create an incredibily powerful minimalist language that makes almost every modern programming language look incredibly complicated by comparison because it really only lets you do three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can define functions.\n",
    "2. You can your functions.\n",
    "3. But you can only call them with other functions.  (Seriously?  WTF?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, let me show you one way we can define the AST for lambdas."
